DESCRIPTION
-----------
This theme extends the default WPadmin theme and provides a flat design.
Also, the footer menu is now placed at the top of the screen.

It is part of RosarioSIS since version 5.0.

CONTENT
-------

### Buttons

The buttons icons set is inside the `btn/` folder.

### Modules icons

The modules icons set is inside the `modules/` folder.

### Logo

Rebrand RosarioSIS: replace the `logo.png` file with your own logo.

### Font

This theme uses _Lato_ font instead of default _Open Sans_.

### Stylesheet

The `stylesheet.css` file simply links to the `WPadmin` theme's stylesheet
and redefines the module icons.

Feel free to add your custom styles or redefine the `WPadmin` ones in the stylesheet.
